Important: When you call the Spotify Accounts service from your application, you will send a redirect-uri in the call. 
The redirect-uri is the address that the Spotify Accounts service redirects to after authorization succeeds or fails. 
If you do not white-list that URI here, authorization will fail. 
Any URI you enter here must exactly match the value you later use in the calls to the Accounts Service, 
including upper/lowercase characters, terminating slashes, and so on.
